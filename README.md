## Keybindings

* LMB - Free look
* W/S - Move camera forward/backward
* A/D - Rotate camera or strafe (if LMB pressed)
* E/Q - Adjust camera height
* R/F - Adjust camera pitch
* Space - Increase render distance
* Shift + Space - Decrease render distance
* LCTRL + Space - Reset render distance to default value

## Building

* On Windows you need to run the ``build.bat`` batch script in Visual Studio Developer Environment. Or... just open Visual Studio Code and press F5 button. If you need png image support, open ``build.bat`` in the text editor and set ``USE_SDL_IMAGE`` to ``1``.
* There are no build script for Linux yet, but it can be compiled without any changes in the source code. Just use ``gcc main.c -oout/vs -DUSE_SDL_IMAGE $(pkg-config --cflags --libs sdl2 SDL2_image)``.


## Notes

* You can change map by dropping two images (height map and diffuse map) on the Voxel Space window.
* Only images with the same dimensions are supported.
